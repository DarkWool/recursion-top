[Check the assignment here!](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion)

## Fibonacci

1. Using iteration, write a function `fibs` which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of __8__, this method should return the array `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]`.
1. Now write another method `fibsRec` which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just a couple of lines.

## Merge Sort

1. Build a function `mergeSort` that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.

## How to test it?

You can do it by using the *node* command:

```
node fibonacci/fibonacci.js
node merge-sort/merge.js
```
